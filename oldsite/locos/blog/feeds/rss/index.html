The main focus of these activities is to increase the income of the beneficiaries, especially the women. To run this initiative, LoCOS has formed women farmers groups and train them to build their capacity on many livelihood options. Those women produce many homestead vegetables like brinjal, bean, pumpkin, gourd, bitter-gourd, lady’s-finger etc, and make handicraft with bamboo and directly sell those products in local and regional markets. They also sell honey collected by their husbands from the Sundarbans, and they produce muster in their field and sell muster-oil in the nearby market. They have association/samity where they have weekly meetings and weekly savings for their financial sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">utsargo</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2017 05:26:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.com/blog/women-entrepreneurship-development/</guid><category>Projects</category></item><item><title>Aquaculture for Income and Nutrition</title><link>http://example.com/blog/aquaculture-for-income-and-nutrition/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Under this World Fish Center, USAID funded project, LoCOS acts as a Depot which duty is to supervise the program activities along with providing the local farmers with fish prawn and fish foods.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">utsargo</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2017 05:23:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.com/blog/aquaculture-for-income-and-nutrition/</guid><category>Projects</category></item><item><title>Integrated Fish Cultivation (Fish Cultivation in the Paddy Field)</title><link>http://example.com/blog/integrated-fish-cultivation-fish-cultivation-in-the-paddy-field/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://localhost:8000/static/media/uploads/%E0%A6%A7%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A8_%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B7%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%87_%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%9B_%E0%A6%9A%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B7-2.jpg" style="float: left;" width="300"/&gt;Integrated Fish cultivation program is funded by Bangladesh NGO’s foundation.

Under this project, rainwater is recharged by infiltration tank to ground water table. Even pond water is also recharged at the dry season. A site supervisor works in every site and takes reading of Electrical conductivity (EC), PH, Turbidity, Temperature, Arsenic (As), Rainfall data, water meter reading, pumping hour, water label, two times regularly and those data have been sent to Department of Geology, University of Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">utsargo</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2017 05:18:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.com/blog/up-scaling-managed-aquifer-recharge-for-providing-community-water-supply-in-saline-areas/</guid><category>Projects</category></item><item><title>Farmers-led Agricultural Development Program</title><link>http://example.com/blog/farmers-led-agricultural-development-program/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://localhost:8000/static/media/uploads/%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%83%E0%A6%B7%E0%A6%95_%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%83%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%87_%E0%A6%A7%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A4_%E0%A6%97%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B7%E0%A6%A3%E0%A6%BE_%E0%A6%AA%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%9F.jpg" style="float: left;" width="300"/&gt;LoCOS has been implementing this MISEREOR funded project in Batiaghata Upazila to create opportunities for the local farmers to develop their living by producing local rice, vegetable in the form of homestead gardening, water melon farming, etc. Under this project LoCOS makes mother trial plot and mini trial plot of various Amon species every year. We provide trainings and workshops to the local farmers to enhance their capacity and knowledge on agricultural production and local and regional market linkage. One of the focus points of this project is to produce food without chemical fertilizer and pesticides. This project also emphasizes on disaster tolerable, salt tolerable, well producible local variety of Amon rice. We have formed 5 male farmers and 10 female farmers groups. Those farmers groups run savings. We maintain a market linkage so that those farmers can sell their products and get a good price. Also we have promoted a value chain process for the agriculture extension system about market enterprise through this program.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">utsargo</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2017 05:15:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.com/blog/farmers-led-agricultural-development-program/</guid><category>Projects</category></item><item><title>Action for the Participatory and Comprehensive Disaster Risk Reduction (APCDRR)</title><link>http://example.com/blog/action-for-the-participatory-and-comprehensive-disaster-risk-reduction-apcdrr/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://localhost:8000/static/media/uploads/%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%83%E0%A6%B7%E0%A6%95_%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%83%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%87_%E0%A6%86%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%A8_%E0%A6%A7%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0_%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE.jpg" style="float: left;" width="300"/&gt;In partnership with Women Job Creation Centre (WJCC) and funded by European Union, LoCOS has been working on reducing vulnerability of disadvantaged people living in disaster prone locations of the Southwestern part of Bangladesh through raising their awareness, building their capacity to develop and implement Disaster Risks Reduction (DRR) action plans; and mobilize them to lobby with the authorities for introducing responsive and comprehensive DRR policy mechanism and implementation strategy as well by facilitating community level DRR platform formation involving all actors. At the project area, several Community-based Disaster Preparedness Committees (CDPC) and School Voluntary Squads have been formed by LoCOS, involving local people and school students. The committee has the responsibility to make community people aware about disaster. Members of Union Parishad are the advisors of CDPCs. two persons from each CDPC committee get Participatory, Vulnerability and Capacity Analysis (PVCA) training session. Validation meetings are arranged to observe, assess the development of this project.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">locos-admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 23 Sep 2017 08:18:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.com/blog/action-for-the-participatory-and-comprehensive-disaster-risk-reduction-apcdrr/</guid><category>Projects</category></item><item><title>This is a demo news</title><link>http://example.com/blog/this-is-a-demo-news/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a demo news&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">locos-admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 23 Sep 2017 08:04:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.com/blog/this-is-a-demo-news/</guid><category>News</category></item></channel></rss>
