## **Ongoing Projects:**

1. **Farmers-led Agricultural Development Program: **LoCOS has been implementing this MISEREOR funded project in Batiaghata Upazila to create opportunities for the local farmers to develop their living by producing local rice, vegetable in the form of homestead gardening, water melon farming, etc. Under this project LoCOS makes mother trial plot and mini trial plot of various Amon species every year. We provide trainings and workshops to the local farmers to enhance their capacity and knowledge on agricultural production and local and regional market linkage. One of the focus points of this project is to produce food without chemical fertilizer and pesticides. This project also emphasizes on disaster tolerable, salt tolerable, well producible local variety of Amon rice. We have formed 10 male farmers and 15 female farmers groups. Those farmers groups run savings. We maintain a market linkage so that those farmers can sell their products and get a good price. Also we have promoted a value chain process for the agriculture extension system about market enterprise through this program.

Under this project, rainwater is recharged by infiltration tank to ground water table. Even pond water is also recharged at the dry season. A site supervisor works in every site and takes reading of Electrical conductivity (EC), PH, Turbidity, Temperature, Arsenic (As), Rainfall data, water meter reading, pumping hour, water label, two times regularly and those data have been sent to Department of Geology, University of Dhaka.

5. **Women Entrepreneurship Development: **LoCOS with its own fund, has initiated some activities to develop women entrepreneurship in Dacope and Batiaghata of Khulna District. The main focus of these activities is to increase the income of the beneficiaries, especially the women. To run this initiative, LoCOS has formed women farmers groups and train them to build their capacity on many livelihood options. Those women produce many homestead vegetables like brinjal, bean, pumpkin, gourd, bitter-gourd, lady’s-finger etc, and make handicraft with bamboo and directly sell those products in local and regional markets. They also sell honey collected by their husbands from the Sundarbans, and they produce muster in their field and sell muster-oil in the nearby market. They have association/samity where they have weekly meetings and weekly savings for their financial sustainability.
