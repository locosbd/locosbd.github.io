LoCOS with its own fund, has initiated some activities to develop women entrepreneurship in Dacope and Batiaghata of Khulna District. The main focus of these activities is to increase the income of the beneficiaries, especially the women. To run this initiative, LoCOS has formed women farmers groups and train them to build their capacity on many livelihood options. Those women produce many homestead vegetables like brinjal, bean, pumpkin, gourd, bitter-gourd, ladyâ€™s-finger etc, and make handicraft with bamboo and directly sell those products in local and regional markets. They also sell honey collected by their husbands from the Sundarbans, and they produce muster in their field and sell muster-oil in the nearby market. They have association/samity where they have weekly meetings and weekly savings for their financial sustainability.
