LoCOS has been implementing this MISEREOR funded project in Batiaghata Upazila to create opportunities for the local farmers to develop their living by producing local rice, vegetable in the form of homestead gardening, water melon farming, etc. Under this project LoCOS makes mother trial plot and mini trial plot of various Amon species every year. We provide trainings and workshops to the local farmers to enhance their capacity and knowledge on agricultural production and local and regional market linkage. One of the focus points of this project is to produce food without chemical fertilizer and pesticides. This project also emphasizes on disaster tolerable, salt tolerable, well producible local variety of Amon rice. We have formed 10 male farmers and 15 female farmers groups. Those farmers groups run savings. We maintain a market linkage so that those farmers can sell their products and get a good price. Also we have promoted a value chain process for the agriculture extension system about market enterprise through this program.
